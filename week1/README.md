problem statement:
The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has created a strong need for data-driven insights into their performance, charging patterns, battery health, and overall cost efficiency. However, real-world EV datasets are often limited, incomplete, or confidential.

This project aims to analyze and model a synthetic Electric Vehicle dataset that represents realistic data across different manufacturers, models, regions, and usage types. The objective is to use this dataset to:

Explore key performance indicators (KPIs) of EVs through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Build predictive models to estimate factors such as EV cost, battery degradation, and charging frequency.

Derive insights for battery optimization, maintenance planning, and sustainability impact (including CO₂ savings).

The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how machine learning and analytics can support data-driven decision-making in the EV industry, promoting sustainable and efficient transportation systems.
